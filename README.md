<h1 align="center">Ammonite Filter (beta)</h1>

<p align="center">The extended filter for <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home.html">AdGuard Home</a></p>

***

# Description:

This repository contains beta version of the <b><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LazyAspect/Ammonite/master/filter.txt">extended filter</a></b> that blocks of adware, ransomware, malware and spyware, phishing and spam, CPA and redirect, fake and scam, advertising and banner networks, tracking and telemetry, analytics and metrics, adult and gambling, chats and push notifications, mining, cryptojacking and illegal pharmacy selling domains. The file is updated regularly.

<b>I recommend using it ONLY together with <a href="https://1.1.1.1">Cloudflare DNS over TLS</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-tls">Google DNS over TLS</a> at the same time for upstream queries. Also <a href="https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html#products">AdGuard</a> is recomended too.</b>

Feel free to contact me with false positive blocks and more domains which need to be blocked. Any feedback will be pleased!
